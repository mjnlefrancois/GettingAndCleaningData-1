# GettingAndCleaningData code book

## Original data

The original data set is available at [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

Coursera provides a ZIP with the [data sets](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). 


## Tidy file

The last two columns of this files are:

* subject: ID of the subject (person) performing the activity. This is a numeric code between 1 and 30 (inclusive).
* activity_name: name of the activity. This is a string, value can be one of LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS or WALKING_UPSTAIRS.

They are preceded by the averages of several measurements (see below). All values are decimal values between -1 and 1.
